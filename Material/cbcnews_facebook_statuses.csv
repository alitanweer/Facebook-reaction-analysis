""Plan A — the pursuit of short-term profit at the exclusion of everything else — isn't working for anyone,"" Arianna Huffington, CEO of Huffington Post Media Group and a member of The B Team, told CBC News via email.

The group, spearheaded by British billionaire Richard Branson and former Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz, believe that for far too long, businesses, in pursuit of short term gain, have not accounted for the costs of their activities and negative impacts on society and the environment. Instead, they need to focus on the long term, and the consequences of their actions.

There is nothing ""inherently wrong with capitalism,"" said Huffington, adding that businesses should not be blamed for society's ills — although that seems to contradict the mission statement which states ""the overwhelming conclusion we’ve reached is that businesses have been a major contributor to the problems.""

On Tuesday, most senior military men in America apologized one after the other for the epidemic of sexual assaults and rapes that has taken place on their watch. 

It was a remarkable spectacle. And it landed with a thud. Some news outlets here did cover the hearing; most hardly bothered.

That's because this is not a story Americans want to hear. Not only does it run counter to the generally accepted view here that the U.S. military is a force for moral good, every one of its members a ""hero,"" but it contains nothing that can be used by partisans on the left or the right to bludgeon their political opponents.

By contrast, the Internal Revenue Service scandal is front-page news just about every day.

The extraordinarily stupid decision by a group of IRS bureaucrats to single out far-right political groups for special consideration may yet become the single most damaging story to hit the Obama administration.

Unlike the military story, the IRS scandal is most definitely a partisan bludgeon.

""Fezzik is a little angora goat with a big personality,"" she writes. ""When he came to my farm, he had a bad infestation of lice and terrible anemia, and I didn't think he'd survive.  He lived indoors for the first few months since he could not stand up for long and would often collapse in a heap, not having the strength to get up by himself.  With a lot of TLC, he's come a long way, and although he will always be small in stature, he makes up for that in many other ways.  This is one of my favourite pictures of him from last summer.""
