The Pluto Time concept was created so that people could experience the approximate sunlight level on Pluto at noon -- generally around dawn or dusk on Earth. Thousands of those submissions have now been assembled into three mosaics of Pluto, Charon, and a combined image of the two. 

The mosaics include not only dim skies on Earth, but famous landmarks, selfies and even family pets. A photo of Clyde Tombaugh, the American who discovered Pluto in 1930, is embedded in this mosaic of hundreds of images shared during the campaign.

Ebola experiments: Medical ethicists are holding a special conference call at the request of the World Health Organization today, to discuss whether it is ethical to use experimental Ebola therapies in this latest outbreak of the disease. It seems the only way to test such treatments is to get them to the scene of a live outbreak, yet new guidelines are needed before conducting such work. There's no word on when the WHO will issue directions.

When people find out I work at CTV National News, I’m usually peppered with the same questions. 

“What’s Lloyd like?”
“What’s Lisa like?”

My answer is fairly boring -- the Lloyd and Lisa you see on TV are pretty much the same as the Lloyd and Lisa you see in everyday life. They’re smart and funny -- just the kind of people you’d want to hang out with. This afternoon, Lloyd took a few minutes after his duties with W5 to visit the National newsroom, which he still does on occasion. Couldn’t resist snapping a selfie with him and Lisa and of course, everyone in the newsroom wanted in on the action. You can pick your friends, but you can’t pick your co-workers -- unless you’re the boss -- but isn’t it nice when they can be both? 

My friends and I are busy crafting tonight’s newscast. We have a lot of great stories on the go, including an EXCLUSIVE from Laurie Graham on what’s undoubtedly a setback in Canada-Russian relations.

Three minutes and 26 seconds. That’s how much time was left in regulation time when the Canadian women’s hockey team began their improbable comeback against their American rivals. The U.S. was up 2-0 and it seemed Canada’s prospects for gold were sliding away. But then, with just 3:26 left to go, the Canadians scored their first goal. Then another. And suddenly, it was tied and the women were off to sudden-death overtime. Not for the faint of heart, if you’re a hockey fan.  By now, you probably know what happened next. The stuff of Olympic legend. Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored in the dying seconds of regulation to tie the game, scored again in overtime. Canada’s golden comeback was complete. A lot of us were watching in the newsroom and hollered, shrieked and jumped when Poulin scored. Where were you when she scored the golden goal? 

By the way, at least the Americans can take (cold) comfort in their stinging defeat knowing they did more to stall workplace productivity in Canada than anything else in recent memory.

He is the most controversial mayor in Toronto’s history. That’s saying something in a city where Mel Lastman was mayor. Remember him? Lastman once joked, just before a diplomatic visit to Kenya, that he was worried he’d be boiled in a pot by African natives. At times today, Toronto City Council resembled a WWE event. Hulk Hogan was nowhere in sight, but one councillor did end up with a fat lip. She was accidently mowed down by an enraged Ford, who was trying to confront a heckler in the audience. Despite all the histrionics of the day -- there was a sobering result. Councillors voted overwhelmingly to strip the mayor of more of his powers. Doug Ford called it a coup d'état. Rob Ford compared it to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait -- with Ford being Kuwait in this scenario. What do you think? Did Mayor Ford deserve to be neutered today by City Hall or was that an overreach by zealous councillors? CTV’s Peter Akman will have the complete story tonight.

Last month, our Ottawa Bureau Chief Robert Fife told us about 1,500 veterans of the Second World War, forced to wait for their Bomber Command honours, simply because the government wanted to hand out the medals in a series of photo-ops with the Veterans Affairs Minister. 
The minister's office reversed course as soon as we started asking questions. 

Last night, Robert Fife had another exclusive, this time, involving a military widow who felt betrayed by the federal government. Her husband died of a heart attack after two previous heart attacks were misdiagnosed by military doctors. 

After accepting at least some blame for her husband's death, one cabinet shuffle later, the government seemingly reversed its own decision. Today, there's been another apparent reversal to the reversal.
